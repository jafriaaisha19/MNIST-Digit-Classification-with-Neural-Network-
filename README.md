# MNIST-Digit-Classification-with-Neural-Network
Problem: Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Data: Utilized the MNIST dataset containing 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Model: Implemented a neural network architecture for image classification.
Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the neural network on the training data.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy.
Deployment: Deployed the trained model for inference on new handwritten digit images.
Conclusion: Developed an accurate neural network model for digit classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in image recognition tasks.
